## Problem Statement

In hospitals and blood banks, managing blood can be really hard. Sometimes, there's not enough blood when someone needs it urgently. Other times, there's too much blood and it goes to waste. People have to do a lot of things manually, like scheduling blood donations or keeping track of how much blood is left. This can lead to mistakes and make things even more difficult. That's why we need HemoHub - to make managing blood easier for everyone.

HemoHub is like a smart helper for hospitals and blood banks. It keeps track of how much blood is available, helps people schedule blood donations, and makes it easy for patients to ask for blood when they need it. By using HemoHub, hospitals can avoid running out of blood when it's needed most, and donors can know when to give blood. It's all about making things simpler and safer for everyone involved.
